FileManager version 0.01
================

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the
README file from a module distribution so that people browsing the
archive can use it get an idea of the modules uses. It is usually a
good idea to provide version information here so that people can
decide whether fixes for the module are worth downloading.

DIRECTORY DATA

With the way this application works - in order to save/manipulate data and 
still have it so that a regular user has access ... the following is
suggested:
  Make the apache web server user a memeber of the group that has access to 
  the designated directories.
  The directories need to be group r/w:
    chmod 0775 <directory_name>
	or
	chmod 0775 `find ./ -type d`
  In order to cause the files/directories created to maintain the permissions,
  set the sgid bit:
    chmod g+s <directory_name>
	or
	chmod g+s `find ./ -type d`
It's just a suggestion....

Have fun and good luck - 8)
